#Spherical X-Means

This is a POC of a Spherical version of XMeans outlined in ["Extending K-means with Effecient Estimation of Number of Clusters"](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dpelleg/download/xmeans.pdf), Pelleg et al., CMU.

Distributed representations of documents tend to cluster similar texts along certain directions. Spherical X-Means can hence be used to cluster and identify topics/themes in document vector space. This algorithm is validated on a sample of normalised document vectors generated by training [Gensim Doc2Vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html) on a larger corpus of news articles.

## Algorithmic Updates

1. The algorithm makes use of [Spherical K-means](https://github.com/clara-labs/spherecluster) instead of vanilla K-Means to cluster data on unit hypersphere.

2. At each level, the algorithm spawns "maxClusters" number of Spherical K-means and selects a model based on their BIC scores.

3. Arc length is the measure of distance between two points on a sphere. On a unit sphere, arc length between two points is equal to the angle between them. Hence, the algorithm uses Sum of Squared Angles (in Degrees) to compute BIC instead of Sum of Squared Errors.

## Usage

```
	# Find appropriate number of clusters in data array X (n_examples x n_features)
	from XMeans import XMeansTraining

	Centers,Labels = XMeansTraining(X,maxBranching = 5,norm = True) # set norm = False if X is not normalized
```	

## Example

"sampleData.json" provides 150 dimensional normalized document vectors of 11957 news articles along with their titles. Refer "Example.ipynb" for implementation details. Spherical X-Means produces 26 clusters on this data. "clusterID.txt"s at "./Clusters" contain titles of articles clustered together.
